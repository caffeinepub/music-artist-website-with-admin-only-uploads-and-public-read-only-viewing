  "summary": "REQ-12 appears implemented: Home page now renders one button per `profile.socials` URL with a platform-specific icon+label when detected, otherwise a generic external-link icon with a non-empty fallback label, and links open in a new tab with `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`. REQ-13 is partially evidenced due to truncation: Releases/Music page was updated to use the same platform detection utility, but it’s not fully visible whether the fallback label for unknown streaming links is \"Listen\" (as required) vs the utility default \"Link\".",

    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "On `/music`, unrecognized `release.streamingLinks` URLs must still render as a button with a generic external-link icon and a non-empty label (e.g., “Listen”).",
      "reason": "The shared `getPlatformInfo()` utility defaults the fallback label to \"Link\". The `ReleasesPage.tsx` change is truncated before showing whether it passes `fallbackLabel: \"Listen\"` when rendering streaming links, so the required \"Listen\"-style fallback is not confirmed from the diff summary.",
